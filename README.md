# MetaInsight v5.1.2
Network meta-analysis (NMA) has been increasingly adopted in evidence-based medicine to compare multiple interventions and address the questions such as ‘which intervention is the ‘best’ overall?’. Currently, NMA is primarily conducted in statistical packages such as WinBUGs, R and STATA, and the software coding can be difficult for non- statisticians and hinders the progress of carrying out systematic reviews containing NMA.

MetaInsight is a tool that conducts NMA via the web requiring no specialist software for the user to install but leveraging established analysis routines (specifically the netmeta and gemtc package in R). The tool is interactive and uses an intuitive ‘point and click’ interface and presents results in visually intuitive and appealing ways. It is hoped that this tool will assist those in conducting NMA who do not have expert statistical programming skills, and, in turn, increase the relevance of published meta-analyses, and in the long term contribute to improved healthcare decision making as a result.
