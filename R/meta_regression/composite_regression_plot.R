#' Create a composite meta-regression plot which comprises plots showing direct and indirect evidence.
#'
#' @param model_output GEMTC model results found by calling `CovariateModelOutput()`.
#' @param treatment_df Data frame containing treatment IDs (Number), sanitised names (Label), and original names (RawLabel).
#' @param outcome_measure Outcome measure of analysis (OR, RR, RD or MD)
#' @param comparators Vector of names of comparison treatments to plot in colour.
#' @param contribution_matrix Contributions from function `CalculateContributions()`.
#' @param contribution_type Type of contribution, used to calculate sizes for the study contribution circles.
#' @param confidence_regions List of confidence region data frames from function `CalculateConfidenceRegions()`.
#' @param include_covariate TRUE if the value of the covariate is to be plotted as a vertical line. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param include_ghosts TRUE if all other comparator studies should be plotted in grey in the background of the plot. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param include_extrapolation TRUE if regression lines should be extrapolated beyond the range of the given data. These will appear as dashed lines.
#' Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param include_confidence TRUE if the confidence regions should be plotted for the specified comparators. These will be partially transparent regions.
#' Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param confidence_opacity The opacity of the confidence regions. Can be any value between 0 and 1, inclusive. Defaults to 0.2.
#' @param include_contributions TRUE if the contributions should be plotted as a circle for each study. Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param contribution_multiplier Factor by which to scale the sizes of the study contribution circles. Defaults to 1.0.
#' @param legend_position String informing the position of the legend. Acceptable values are:
#' - "BR" - Bottom-right of the plot area
#' - "BL" - Bottom-left of the plot area
#' - "TR" - Top-right of the plot area
#' - "TL" - Top-left of the plot area
#'
#' @return Created ggplot2 object.
