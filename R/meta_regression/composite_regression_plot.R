#' Create a composite meta-regression plot which comprises plots showing direct and indirect evidence.
#'
#' @param model_output GEMTC model results found by calling `CovariateModelOutput()`.
#' @param treatment_df Data frame containing treatment IDs (Number), sanitised names (Label), and original names (RawLabel).
#' @param outcome_measure Outcome measure of analysis (OR, RR, RD or MD)
#' @param comparators Vector of names of comparison treatments to plot in colour.
#' @param is_direct Contributions from function `CalculateDirectness()`.
#' @param credible_regions List of credible region data frames from function `CalculateCredibleRegions()`.
#' @param include_covariate TRUE if the value of the covariate is to be plotted as a vertical line. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param include_ghosts TRUE if all other comparator studies should be plotted in grey in the background of the plot. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param include_extrapolation TRUE if regression lines should be extrapolated beyond the range of the given data. These will appear as dashed lines.
#' Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param include_credible TRUE if the credible regions should be plotted for the specified comparators. These will be partially transparent regions.
#' Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param credible_opacity The opacity of the credible regions. Can be any value between 0 and 1, inclusive. Defaults to 0.2.
#' @param covariate_symbol The selected symbol for displaying covariates. Defaults to "circle open".
#' @param covariate_symbol_size Size of the covariate symbols. Defaults to 10.
#' @param legend_position String informing the position of the legend. Acceptable values are:
#' - "BR" - Bottom-right of the plot area
#' - "BL" - Bottom-left of the plot area
#' - "TR" - Top-right of the plot area
#' - "TL" - Top-left of the plot area
#'
#' @return Created ggplot2 object.
