      (sqrt({sum($dev.ab)}/{number of arms}) for each study).
      The leverage for each data point, is calculated as the posterior mean of the residual
      deviance, minus the deviance at the posterior mean of the fitted values. The leverage plot may be used to
      identify influential and/or poorly fitting studies and can be used to check how each study is affecting
      the overall model fit and DIC. Curves of the form x2 + y = c, c = 1, 2, 3, ., where x represents square root
      of residual deviance, and y represents the leverage, are marked on the plot. Points lying on such parabolas
      each contribute an amount c to the DIC (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002). Points that lie outside the line with
      c = 3 can generally be identified as contributing to the model's poor fit. Points with a high leverage are
      influential, which means that they have a strong influence on the model parameters that generate their fitted
      values. (Further reading: Dias S, Ades AE, Welton NJ, Jansen JP, Sutton AJ. Network meta-anlaysis for
