\title{Find the lowest and highest covariate values given by a study comparing the reference and comparator treatments.
This does noes not include studies which do not directly compare treatments to the reference.}
\usage{
FindCovariateRanges(
  connected_data,
  treatment_df,
  reference_treatment,
  covariate_title,
  baseline_risk = FALSE,
  outcome = NULL,
  model = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{connected_data}{Data frame from which to find covariate ranges}

\item{treatment_df}{data frame containing treatment names ("Label") and IDs ("Number")}

\item{reference_treatment}{Name of reference treatment.}

\item{covariate_title}{Title of covariate column in data. Only required when @param baseline_risk == FALSE.}

\item{baseline_risk}{TRUE if the covariate is baseline risk. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{outcome}{"binary" or "continuous". Only required when @param baseline_risk == TRUE. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{model}{Model created by bnma::network.run(). Only required when @param baseline_risk == TRUE. Defaults to NULL.}
}
\value{
The lowest and highest covariate values of relevant studies. This is structured as a list containing 2 items:
\itemize{
\item "min" a named vector of the lowest values, where the names are the treatment names.
\item "max" a named vector of the highest values, where the names are the treatment names.
}
}
