### **What is *MetaInsight*?**  

<img src="logo.png" alt="logo" style="width: 300px; float:right; padding:10px;"/>

Network meta-analysis (NMA) has been increasingly adopted in evidence-based medicine to compare multiple interventions and address the questions such as ‘which intervention is the ‘best’ overall?’. Currently, NMA is primarily conducted in statistical packages such as WinBUGs, R and STATA, and the software coding can be difficult for non-statisticians and hinders the progress of carrying out systematic reviews containing NMA.

MetaInsight is a tool that conducts NMA via the web requiring no specialist software for the user to install but leveraging established analysis routines (specifically the netmeta and gemtc packages in R). The tool is interactive and uses an intuitive ‘point and click’ interface and presents results in visually intuitive and appealing ways. It is hoped that this tool will assist those in conducting NMA who do not have expert statistical programming skills, and, in turn, increase the relevance of published meta-analyses, and in the long term contribute to improved healthcare decision making as a result.

### **Attributes of _MetaInsight_**

This version of *MetaInsight* was built using *<a href = "https://cran.r-project.org/package=shinyscholar" target="_blank">shinyscholar</a>* and has these attributes:

* **accessible**: lowers barriers to conducting complex meta-analysis by providing an intuitive graphical user interface
* **open**: the code is free to use and modify (GPL 3.0) and <a href="https://github.com/CRSU-Apps/MetaInsight" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a>
* **expandable**: users can author and contribute modules that enable new methodological options
* **flexible**: options for user uploads and downloads of results
* **interactive**: includes an embedded sortable `{DF}` data tables, and visualizations of results
* **instructive**: features guidance text that educates users about theoretical and analytical aspects of each step in the workflow
* **reproducible**: users can download a `{quarto}` .qmd file that when run reproduces the analysis, and also save sessions and load them later
* **reliable**: modules and their underlying functions are tested using `{testthat}` and `{shinytest2}`
