### **Attributes of _MetaInsight_**

This version of *MetaInsight* was built using *shinyscholar* and has these attributes:

* **accessible**: lowers barriers to conducting complex meta-analysis by providing an intuitive graphical user interface
* **open**: the code is free to use and modify (GPL 3.0) and can be viewed from inside the application
* **expandable**: users can author and contribute modules that enable new methodological options
* **flexible**: options for user uploads and downloads of results
* **interactive**: includes an embedded sortable `{DF}` data tables, and visualizations of results
* **instructive**: features guidance text that educates users about theoretical and analytical aspects of each step in the workflow
* **reproducible**: users can download an `{rmarkdown}` .Rmd file that when run reproduces the analysis, and also save sessions and load them later
* **reliable**: modules and their underlying functions are tested using `{testthat}` and `{shinytest2}`
